# Label Maker

## Project Overview
Label Maker is a web application designed to help users create professional product package labels without the need for a designer. This application is specifically tailored for a plumbing parts manufacturer, but it showcases coding and design skills that can be adapted for various industries.

## Objective
The main objective of Label Maker is to streamline the process of creating product package labels. Users can fill in a simple form with the required data, and the application will generate a high-resolution PDF ready for printing. This saves significant time, reducing the process from hours to minutes.

## Key Features
- **User-Friendly Form**: A simple and intuitive form for entering label details.
- **High-Resolution PDF Export**: Labels are exported as high-resolution PDFs, ready for printing.
- **Design Tokens**: Consistent use of design tokens for colors and styles.
- **Branding**: Incorporates the client's branding, including specific colors and fonts.

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **MySQL**: A relational database for storing user data and label designs.
- **PDFKit**: A library for creating PDF documents.
