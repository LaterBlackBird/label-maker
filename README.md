# Label Maker

## Project Overview
Label Maker is a web application designed to help users create professional product package labels without the need for a designer. This application is specifically tailored for a plumbing parts manufacturer, but it showcases coding and design skills that can be adapted for various industries.

## Objective
The main objective of Label Maker is to streamline the process of creating product package labels. Users can fill in a simple form with the required data, and the application will generate a high-resolution PDF ready for printing. This saves significant time, reducing the process from hours to minutes.

## Key Features
- **User-Friendly Form**: A simple and intuitive form for entering label details.
- **High-Resolution PDF Export**: Labels are exported as high-resolution PDFs, ready for printing.
- **Design Tokens**: Consistent use of design tokens for colors and styles.
- **Branding**: Incorporates the client's branding, including specific colors and fonts.

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **MySQL**: A relational database for storing user data and label designs.
- **PDFKit**: A library for creating PDF documents.

## Getting Started
To get started with the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
